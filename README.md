## ðŸš€ Algoritmo e lÃ³gica de programaÃ§Ã£o 

<p>I've been on an Udemy course about algorithms and programming logic with Javascript and I intend to bring here everrthing I will learn there.</p>

<p>âš  before learning the basics of javascript I learned what is programming logic. Programming logic is structuring of concepts and rules that guide the execution of the algorithm, the algorithm is the recipe, that is,
the commands in a clear and logical step by step that lead the actions to solve a problem or to reach a certain objective.</p>
